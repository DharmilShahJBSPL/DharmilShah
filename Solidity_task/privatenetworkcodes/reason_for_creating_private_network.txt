How to create private network on the ethereum network ? 

drawbacks on the main network :-

From an experimental, testing perspective there are two main drawbacks to using the main Ethereum network. 
Firstly, of course starting Ethereum with the default network settings will result in your peer (full) node downloading the entire Ethereum blockchain. 
This takes a significant amount of time and requires a lot of storage on your local disk. 
Secondly any activity on the main Ethereum network requires “gas”. Whilst this gas is obtainable, it involves purchasing and depositing actual ETH into 
your account. You may not want to do this just for rapid experimentation and testing


Private Network :-

A private network requires negligible local disk storage and can be operated without having to purchase ETH with real money. An Ethereum network is a 
private network if the nodes are not connected to the main network nodes. In this context private only means reserved or isolated, rather than protected or secure.
