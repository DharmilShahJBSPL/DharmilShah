eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase) = displayed the acccount with balance 

eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[1]) = displayed the acccount with balance

eth.getBalance.. will return the value in form of wei so to convert into ether used this

web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase),"ether")

miner.stop =  used to stop the mining process and check on the other terminal where startnode is execution to see that whether that is stop or not

miner.start(1) = displayed that mining is start processing with line displaying updated mining thread = "1"

net.version = display network id

personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[1],"pass1234", 300) = used to open particular account with password pass1234 for specified amount of duration which is 300 seconds = 5 min

personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[1]) = same but in this the terminal will asked to enter the password which is pass1234 and default durations is 10 min

eth.sendTransaction({from: eth.coinbase, to: eth.accounts[1], value: web3.toWei(10, "ether")}) =  used to transfer the ether
