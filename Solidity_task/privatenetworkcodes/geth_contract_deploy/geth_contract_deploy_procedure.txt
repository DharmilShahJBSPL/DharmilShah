			Deploying the Contract through geth

open console type geth --datadir "E:\dharmil\Task\Solidity_task\privatenetworkcodes\communication_within_same_pc\testing\node1" --networkid 1111 --rpc --rpcport 8545 --rpccorsdomain "*" console 2>console.log
create/open contract in Remix 
change the environment to web 3 provider and specify the port. it should be same as rpc port 
create account if not
start mining miner.start(1)
eth.blockNumber
eth.hashrate
deploy contract on remix 
it will take time to mined the contract
type eth.pendingTransactions and check whether your contract is mined . If it is mined it will return [] else details of pendingTransactions

now to call function from geth follow this

in geth console 

var abi = [{"constant": true,"inputs": [{"name": "a","type": "int256"},{"name": "b","type": "int256"}],"name": "add","outputs": [{"name": "","type": "int256"}],"payable": false,"stateMutability": "view","type": "function"},{"constant": true,"inputs": [],"name": "getName","outputs": [{"name": "","type": "string"}],"payable": false,"stateMutability": "view","type": "function"},{"constant": false,"inputs": [{"name": "_name","type": "string"}],"name": "setName","outputs": [],"payable": false,"stateMutability": "nonpayable","type": "function"},{"constant": false,"inputs": [{"name": "a","type": "int256"},{"name": "b","type": "int256"},{"name": "_name","type": "string"}],"name": "addAndRename","outputs": [{"name": "","type": "int256"}],"payable": false,"stateMutability": "nonpayable","type": "function"}]
it will returned undefined which is proper

then type abi it will show the above abi in proper format

var address = "copy the contract address"
address will display our contract address

then define one variable and perform this command
var adder1 = eth.contract(abi).at(address)
it will returned undefined which is fine

type adder1
which will show our's contract abi, contract address and function of our contract 

eth.defaultAccount=eth.accounts[0]
personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0])

now access the function with defined variable which is adder1 in this case
adder1.getName()
adder1.setName("dharmil contract")
adder1.getName()

and you can also check on the remix it will return the same name
