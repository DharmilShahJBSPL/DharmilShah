In the tether token the transfer is generated using this uint fee = (_value.mul(basisPointsRate)).div(10000);

Methods dont work while calling the pause method are :- approve, allowance, set param , total supply , add black list , get blacklist status, is blacklist , 
remove blacklist , issue, redeem, transfer ownership, get ownership, deprecate, upgraded address .
