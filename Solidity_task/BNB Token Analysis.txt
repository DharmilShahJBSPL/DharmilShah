BNB Token Analysis

It uses a custom matching engine to match buyers and sellers at the requested prices. Once the trade is processed, each customer receives 
what they want, and Binance receives a small fee for providing the matching and exchange service. This is how an exchange makes a profit.
BNB supports multiple utilities on the Binance ecosystem, which includes paying for trading fees, exchange fees, listing fees, and any other 
fees on the Binance exchange.One of the key parts of the BNB token is the plans for buying back the tokens and burning them


Binance Coin Burn :-

If your discount keeps decreasing won’t that make the token worthless eventually. Well, that will be helped as more and more people come to the 
exchange, but the founders at Binance also found another solution to keep the value of the token from dropping. Every quarter they take 20% of 
their profits from fees and use it to buy coins and “burn” them, or destroy them.


Fallback, withdraw, burn, freeze and unfreeze are main functionality of the BNB token.
